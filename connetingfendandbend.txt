====signup functionality====

install react-router-dom.
main.jsx --> wrap app with BrowserRouter, import ReactDOM.
app.jsx --> Use Routes inside div, then use Route inside Routes to navigate elements.
vite.config.js --> change port to 3000 inside server

login.jsx --> Link to signup {if Don't have an ac}
signup.jsx --> Link to login {if already have an ac},
                keep track of inputs using useState, 
                add value and trigger event in each inputs,
                handleSubmit in form (console log inputs and can see the values in the console),
                handleCheckboxChange and add call back in genderCheckbox (pass props and field in genderCheckbox.jsx),

===we can add signup functionality in handleSubmit but it will look messy, so we will use hooks.===

src>>hooks??useSignup.js (from here we will return values).
                useState for loading
                signup fxn to handle input error for validation --> define the handleInputError fxn below
                import signup in Signup.jsx 
                fetch api and extract the data, also use loading state.
                get loading and signup in useSignup.jsx
=== TEST == by trying to sign.
                    run server ==> npm run server
                    frontend ==> npm run dev
blocked by cors policy ==> change in develoment vite.config.js ==> proxy:
